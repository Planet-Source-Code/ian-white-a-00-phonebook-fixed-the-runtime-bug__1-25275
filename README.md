### Description

PLEASE FIND A BUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DARE YA! I fixed the one that was found when you type somthign in the main interface when you have an empty dat file then click in the search list box. See if u can find more. By the way PLEASE VOTE!!!! thanx ;-)

Well finally after heaps of emails complaining about the source safe protection HERE you go!! a non protected version, as you will see the code is a shocka, it really needs arrays. It reads everything off a text file to save HD Space. I am going to make an Access version prolly in about a month or so, well maybe longer coz i am doing my HSC. Anyway, this prog provides a simple to use, yet useful phonebook/contacts program. I have gone through and sussed out pretty much every bug I could think of, see if you can find any!

I DARE YA TO FIND A BUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
